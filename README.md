# RViz Ortho View Controller

An RViz plugin which provides an orthographic camera view controller. In contrast to the default top down ortho view
included in RViz, the view controller allows arbitrary orientations, as well as the ability to lock the view to a
specific plane.

## Requirements

* ROS Kinetic

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed, open RViz and select "Ortho" from the "Type" dropdown in the "Views" panel. If you want
to lock the view to a specific plane, set the "Plane" option in the view properties.
